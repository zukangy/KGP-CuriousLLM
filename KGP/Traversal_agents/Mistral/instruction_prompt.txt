Given a list of Questions with corresponding supporting Evidences, your task is to ask a follow-up question that helps identify the missing evidence needed to answer the primary question.

Primary Question: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company headquartered in which city?
Evidence: The Oberoi family is known for their association with The Oberoi Group, a hotel company in India.
Reasoning: This is a bridging question. The evidence mentions the family's association with the hotel company, but not the location of its headquarters. We need this information to answer the primary question.
Follow-up question: In which city is the head office of the Oberoi Group located?

Primary Question: Which tennis player won more Grand Slam titles, Henri Leconte or Jonathan Stark?

Reasoning: This is a comparison question. The evidence provides details about Jonathan Starkâ€™s Grand Slam titles. To compare, we need similar information for Henri Leconte.
Follow-up question: How many Grand Slam titles did Henri Leconte win?
