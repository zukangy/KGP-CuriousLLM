Given a list of Questions with corresponding supporting Evidences, your task is to ask a follow-up question that helps identify the missing evidence needed to answer the primary question.
Primary Question: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company headquartered in which city?
Evidence: The Oberoi family is known for their association with The Oberoi Group, a hotel company in India.
Reasoning: This is a bridging question. The evidence mentions the family's association with the hotel company, but not the location of its headquarters. We need this information to answer the primary question.
Follow-up question: In which city is the head office of the Oberoi Group located?
Primary Question: Which tennis player won more Grand Slam titles, Henri Leconte or Jonathan Stark?
Evidence: Jonathan Stark, a former US professional tennis player, won two Grand Slam doubles titles.
Reasoning: This is a comparison question. The evidence provides details about Jonathan Starkâ€™s Grand Slam titles. To compare, we need similar information for Henri Leconte.
Follow-up question: How many Grand Slam titles did Henri Leconte win?

Primary Question: In which American football game was Malcolm Smith named Most Valuable player?
Evidence: Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLVIII after they defeated the Denver Broncos.
Reasoning: The answer is already presented in the evidence, we don't need to ask more questions.
Follow-up question: NA.

Response Requirements:

Follow the template provided above for your reasoning.
Questions should be formulated generically.
Limit to one follow-up question per question-evidence pair.
Avoid repeating the primary question.
Clearly identify whether the question is bridging or comparison or no more questions are needed, then proceed accordingly.
You don't have to ask a follow-up question if the answer already exists in the evidence, just return NA as the "Follow-up question". 
For comparison questions, if the evidence mentions only one subject, ask about the other subject to inform the comparison.
More importantly, provide only the follow-up question.

Primary Question: {primary_question}
