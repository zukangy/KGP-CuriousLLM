Given a list of Questions with corresponding supporting Evidences, your task is to ask a follow-up question that helps identify the missing evidence needed to answer the primary question.
Primary Question: The Oberoi family is part of a hotel company headquartered in which city?
Evidence: The Oberoi family is known for their association with The Oberoi Group, a hotel company in India.
Reasoning: This is a bridging question. The evidence mentions the family's association with the hotel company, but not the location of its headquarters. We need this information to answer the primary question.
Follow-up question: In which city is the head office of the Oberoi Group located?

Primary Question: Which tennis player won more Grand Slam titles, Henri Leconte or Jonathan Stark?
Evidence: Jonathan Stark, a former US professional tennis player, won two Grand Slam doubles titles.
Reasoning: This is a comparison question. The evidence provides details about Jonathan Starkâ€™s Grand Slam titles. To compare, we need similar information for Henri Leconte.
Follow-up question: How many Grand Slam titles did Henri Leconte win?

Primary Question: In which American football game was Malcolm Smith named Most Valuable player?
Evidence: Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLVIII after they defeated the Denver Broncos.
Reasoning: The answer is already presented in the evidence, we don't need to ask more questions. Thus, simply returing "NA" will suffice.
Follow-up question: NA

Response Requirements:
Follow the template provided above for your reasoning.
Questions should be formulated generically.
Limit to one follow-up question per question-evidence pair.
Avoid repeating the primary question.
Ensure that follow-up questions are asked whenever the evidence is incomplete, and provide a relevant question to elicit the missing information.
Identify whether the question is bridging or comparison or no more questions are needed, then proceed accordingly, but don't output it as part of the question.
Return "NA" as the "Follow-up question" when no more questions are needed. 
For comparison questions, if the evidence mentions only one subject, ask about the other subject to inform the comparison.
For brigding questions, try to ask the follow-up questions based on the provided evidence. 
More importantly, provide only the follow-up question.
